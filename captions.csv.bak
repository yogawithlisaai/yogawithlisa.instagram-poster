I’m a millennial biochemist living in the Bay, a place buzzing with ambition, ideas, and innovation. I love it here. The tech, the science, the drive, the brilliance, it’s absolutely electric. But that same energy that fuels our dreams can also make the city feel heavy. The competition, the long hours, the constant chase, it can leave us feeling disconnected, even lonely.

I’ve spent most of my adult life here, pursuing my PhD at UC Berkeley, exploring biotech startups, and falling in love, twice. Both times, I watched love buckle under the weight of expectation and pressure. It’s strange how a city that inspires so much creativity can also chip away at some of the most genuine initial connections.

After heartbreak, I found yoga. After injury, I found yoga. After the loss of of loved one to COVID, I found yoga. 
Through the practice, I began to rebuild the connection between my body and my heart. Each pose became a way to listen again, to breathe again, to be gentle and kind with myself, again. Yoga became a way to come home to myself, building my self-esteem, confidence, and sense of inner peace in the process.

Now, I practice and teach yoga surrounded by my family, my best friends, and beautiful souls in the city who lift me up, who laugh with me, who remind me that healing can be beautiful. We meet in studios, parties, rooftops, and sometimes just over tea. And in those spaces, I’ve realized: yoga isn’t about escaping the city — it’s about learning how to be in it. How to stay soft and grounded in a world that asks us to be hard, and often in a constant state of flux.

At Yoga with Lisa, I want to hold space for that: for softness, strength, reflection, and high-vibrational living. It’s for anyone navigating love, ambition, and self-discovery in a city that never stops moving.

It’s a reminder that you can chase your dreams, lose your balance, fall in love, fall apart, and still come home to yourself again and again. #YogaWithLisa #YogaInTheCity #BayAreaYoga #MindfulLiving #SoftnessIsStrength #FeminineEnergy #YogaJourney #UrbanYoga #YogaForHealing #HeartOpening #YogaForTheSoul #WellnessJourney #MindBodyConnection #SanFranciscoYoga #BayAreaLife #HealingThroughMovement #HighVibrationalLiving #YogaForMentalHealth #YogaEverywhere #YogaCommunity #HolisticHealing #ResilienceThroughYoga #ModernWellness #YogaTeacherLife

The ocean has the capacity to literally calm your physiology. 

Research shows that blue spaces, especially coastal ones, lower cortisol, slow your heart rate, and activate the parasympathetic (“rest and digest”) system. 

The rhythmic sound of waves mimics a meditative breath pattern, entraining your nervous system into balance. 

The ocean is one of the greatest teachers of prāṇāyāma, or breath, the rhythm of inhale and exhale, rise and fall. 

Prāṇa (प्राण) = life force, vital energy, breath

Āyāma (आयाम) = expansion, regulation, or extension

So prāṇāyāma means “the expansion or regulation of life force through breath.”    #YogaWithLisa #YogaInTheCity #SanFranciscoYoga #BayAreaYoga #MindfulBreathing #Pranayama #BlueMind #OceanHealing #NeuroscienceOfCalm #Breathwork #CityWellness #FeminineEnergy #SoftnessIsStrength #YogaScience #RestAndDigest #SFViews #BayAreaLife #WellnessJourney #MindBodyConnection #InnerCalm",FALSE
2025-11-02,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yogawithlisaai/yogawithlisa.instagram-poster/main/images/ig3.jpg,city,3,"Sometimes healing doesn’t start with words.
It starts with breath.

Lion’s breath reminds us to release what we’ve been holding — the tension in our jaw, the weight on our heart, the stories we’ve outgrown.
It’s the sound of letting go.

Ujjayi breath, the ocean breath, calls us home.
Its rhythm mirrors the tide — steady, alive, infinite.
A reminder that even in chaos, we can find calm.

Yoga isn’t just about movement. It’s about regulation.
Breathwork rewires your nervous system, quiets your mind, and invites your body to remember safety again.

This is what it means to practice softness as strength.
To exhale the city noise and inhale your own peace.

Uj = to expand, conquer, or be victorious
Jaya = victory or triumph

So Ujjayi literally means “victorious breath.”

It’s sometimes called “the ocean breath” because of its soft, wave-like sound — steady and rhythmic, like the tide.
